      Upon successful completion of YZV231E, students are expected to be able to: <br>
          &nbsp;1. Define laws and axioms of probability and be able to work with set theoretical rules of events and probabilities and concept of independence <br>
          &nbsp;2. Construct probabilities and conditional probabilities; use them in Bayes law to model simple real life problems <br>
          &nbsp;3. Know and utilize random variables (r.v.s), important standard models of probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative density functions in both continuous and discrete space <br>
          &nbsp;4. Express multiple r.v.s with joint pdfs, relating to marginal pdfs and conditional pdfs, as well as to concepts of independence and correlatedness <br>
          &nbsp;5. Estimate means, variances, covariances, moments of random variables and random vectors <br>
          &nbsp;6. Calculate best predictors in minimum mean squared sense both for linear and nonlinear predictors <br>
          &nbsp;7. Know the meaning and implications of limit theorems : Law of large numbers and Central limit theorem <br>
          &nbsp;8. Define and Utilize Basic Bayesian Statistical Inference Techniques and Classical Statistical Inference Techniques including Hypothesis Testing, Parameter Estimation, Linear Regression and Significance Testing. <br>
          &nbsp;9. Implement the above concepts in a programming environment (PYTHON)
