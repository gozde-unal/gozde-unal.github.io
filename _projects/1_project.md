# Continual Learning of Multi-modal Dynamics with External Memory (CDDP)

        <ol>
            <li> We introduce the first study on Continual Learning of Multi-modal Dynamical Systems</li>
            <li> We introduce Competitive baseline Variational Continual Learning - Bayesian State-Space Model </li>
            <li> We propose a novel solution which is Continual Dynamic Dirichlet Process (CDDP) based on external memory  </li>
